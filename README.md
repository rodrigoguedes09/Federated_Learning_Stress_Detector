# Federated_Stress_Detector

Stress is a growing concern that negatively affects the health and well-being of a large portion of the global population. In this context, we propose a system that addresses the challenges of stress classification, considering the sensitivity of personal data, real-time analysis and the use of low-power microcontrollers. By utilizing a Federated Learning framework, a real-time display interface, the flexible TinyDB database, and the ESP32 microcontroller, our system collects data through biomarkers and processes it in real-time, training stress classification models locally on edge devices. The federated models are aggregated to obtain a global model, which is then deployed to the devices. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this system for real-time stress classification, ensuring user privacy and highlighting the compatibility of these functionalities in edge computing.
